# How it works?

Testinator takes exported xml automations from [Katalon](https://www.katalon.com) as input and using java, translate them to selenium commands and launch them with LocalDriver or RemoteDriver.

# Prerequisites

- Java 8
- Some browser in local environment or remote environment.

# Steps

- Download the last or stable version of Testinator from here.
- Configure the local or remote driver according to the target browser.
- Generate Katalon automations and export them to xml
- Execute Testinator commands following the guideline.
- A local or remote browser will be open and will execute the selenium commands.

Detailed steps are on the [wiki](https://github.com/utec/testinator/wiki) page.
